title: About This Site

::: section text-block
**ModelPaintMixer.com** is intended to be a centralized repository
for paints and custom color mixes for the scale modeling community.
The original idea was suggested to me in 2018 after I had gone through
considerable effort to find recipes for the Caunter Scheme colors for
a World War II subject.

While the site is currently limited in focus to paints from the
company [Tamiya, Inc.](/manufacturer/?id=1), the goal is to
expand to other manufacturers over time.

### Technical Details

This site is created using the [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org)
site creation tool built upon the [React](https://reactjs.org/)
JavaScript framework. The typography and text theming come from the
[Typography.js](https://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/)
project, using the Fairy Gates theme. Icons used for navigation are
from the
[Material Design Icons](https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/) set.

The background image is from the the collection,
["Free Camouflage Patterns for Illustrator & Photoshop"](https://blog.spoongraphics.co.uk/freebies/free-camouflage-patterns-for-illustrator-photoshop)
from the [Spoon Graphics](https://blog.spoongraphics.co.uk/)
blog. The background uses the "Woodland Camouflage" image, converted
to PNG and the opacity adjusted down to 25%.
