## About This Site

This site is created using the
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org "Gatsby home")
site creation tool built upon the
[React](https://reactjs.org/ "React home") JavaScript framework.
The typography and text theming come from the
[Typography.js](https://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/ "Typography.js home")
project, using the Fairy Gates theme. Icons used for navigation are from the
[Material Design Icons](https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/ "Material Design icons")
set.

The background image is from the the collection,
["Free Camouflage Patterns for Illustrator & Photoshop"]
(https://blog.spoongraphics.co.uk/freebies/free-camouflage-patterns-for-illustrator-photoshop)
from the [Spoon Graphics](https://blog.spoongraphics.co.uk/) blog. The
background uses the "Woodland Camouflage" image, converted to PNG and the
opacity adjusted down to 25%.
